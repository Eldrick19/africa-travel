Ivory Coast Tourist Visa Information
The Ivory Coast E-visa is an electronic visa for the West African country obtained through an online application.

This online visa was introduced to remove the need for eligible nationalities to wait in long border queues for an Ivory Coast visa on arrival or apply for a visa from an Ivory Coast consulate or embassy.

An Ivory Coast visa online allows travel to the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire for tourism, business, or transit purposes.

Once approved, it is valid for 90 days and permits the holder multiple entries to the Ivory Coast during its validity.

Eligible nationalities can submit an Ivory coast visa application online by completing a simple electronic form with basic personal, passport, and travel information. It is also necessary to upload a few supporting documents and pay the E-visa processing fee before the form can be submitted.

An E-visa for the Ivory Coast is usually processed within 48 hours, and once approved, is sent to the traveler by email alongside a receipt of payment.

This ‘approved pre-enrollment’ document and the receipt should then be printed to present upon arrival at Port Bouet Airport in Abidjan, the only authorized port of entry for the E-visa in Ivory Coast.

After performing a mandatory biometric enrollment at immigration control, the traveler is then present with a printed E-visa and permitted expedited entry to Ivory Coast.

In order to visit Côte d’Ivoire for other purposes or longer periods than those permitted with an approved E-visa, it will be necessary for the traveler to contact an Ivory Coast embassy or consulate for further information.

Ivory Coast E-visa Requirements
In order to submit an E-visa application online, it is first necessary to meet the electronic Ivory Coast visa requirements.

The online Ivory Coast tourist visa requirements are the same as those for an electronic Ivory Coast business visa or transit visa, and state that it is necessary to supply the following to submit an application:

Image of the biographical page of a valid passport
Copy of confirmed flight tickets for the Ivory Coast
Confirmed accommodation booking or letter of invitation from Ivory Coast
Valid credit or debit card details to pay the E-Visa fee
Current email address at which to receive the approved E-visa
Ivory Coast E-visa requirements also specify that the applicant must also have travel insurance valid for the entire duration of the stay in order for an application to be approved.

Upon arrival at Port Bouet Airport, it is necessary for travelers to present:

The same passport, valid for at least 6 months, used to complete the online application
The “Approved pre-enrollment” document (sent to the traveler via email)
Receipt of payment of the E-visa fees
Certificate of vaccination against yellow fever.
Once the traveler provides biometric details (fingerprints and photo) to immigration authorities, they will then be granted their printed E-visa and permitted expedited entry to the country.

Note: Biometric enrollment is compulsory for all E-visa holders aged 12 or over, even though the traveler has previously been issued a visa for the Ivory Coast.
